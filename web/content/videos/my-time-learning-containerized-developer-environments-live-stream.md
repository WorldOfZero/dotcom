Earlier this week we explored remote container environments for development that allow you to install, run and debug your development environments inside of isolated containers. By using containers this approach enables a few things: your development experience can be more consistent across multiple developers and each project has its own environment (less likely to introduce weird behavior because of some custom setup, a tool for a different project or missing dependency).

This is the first time I've really taken a dive into this feature so lets see what we can find out, if there are any significant pain points to keep in mind or ways to improve the experience. If you use these development environments and have suggestions I'd love to hear them!
