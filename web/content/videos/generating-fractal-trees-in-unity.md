Lets make some fractals in Unity and take the opportunity to explore messaging in Unity. We'll make an extensible, component based fractal generator that is capable of generating fractal trees easily.

Better yet, this design allows us to easily create simple components that can be combined however we want to create awesome, unique shapes!

Not bad for 20 minutes work.

Also, did I mention how awesome fractals are? Does this make math cool yet?
