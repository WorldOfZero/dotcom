`ScriptableObject`'s are a way to make configurable objects you can attach to `MonoBehavior`'s or others objects. This allows you to quickly create and swap out data on your game objects without having to create and manage entire object Prefabs. You can use this to manage things like enemy health, weapon stats or character behaviors.

Creating [`ScriptableObject`'s allows you to configure Mono Behavior's using pre-configured data](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html)

You can use the `CreateAssetMenuAttribute` to [create asset menus and more easily create new `ScriptableObject`'s](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CreateAssetMenuAttribute.html).
