Continuing on from yesterday we're going to be exploring our Squishy Sphere Shader. Specifically, in this video we'll be updating our shader to squish a bit better. It will be more accurate and have a way to smooth out the curve so it splats out a little better than it did previously.

There is still work to do though: we still aren't updating our Y position correctly. Frankly, most of the math isn't correct. That also needs work. The fixes for this will be coming in the next video of the series. But for now, we've at least got a pretty cool splat!
