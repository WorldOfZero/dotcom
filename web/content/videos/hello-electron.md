Electron is a tool that allows you to convert webpages into full applications that can run outside of a browser and interact more closely with your operating system. This makes it a very useful tool, especially if you already have a website created.

We're going to walk through the basic Electron Quick Start and talk through a how this works. I've never worked with Electron before so we'll be learning how to use it together and this is the most basic of initial steps.

My familiarity with the web stack is also fairly minimal so there are some mistakes we'll certainly need to work through.

We use the electron quick start guide from here: https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/
