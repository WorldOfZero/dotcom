Hello Internet, welcome to Hello C#! We're going to be exploring the very basics of how to write a Hello World application in C# all the way from project creation to the end. This is a simple application, the simplest I could think of, but that's sort of the point.

This Hello series is all about creating simple explorations of various technologies. This is the first, but certainly not the last of this style. We'll explore more than programming languages from testing frameworks to various development platforms etc.

If there is a project you'd like me to explore let me know in the comments below. Let's learn it together!
