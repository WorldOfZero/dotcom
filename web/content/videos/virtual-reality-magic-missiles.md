I've been tinkering with VR development. This is building up to a mages duel game where two players will have to cast and avoid spells to become victorious. This demo is after the first day of development. Shortly after completing VIVE integration.

Nothing too interesting happening here. I didn't even add audio. But VR is cool.

More about this game will be coming soon and I'll be making a demo available on Game Jolt eventually. It's too early for that right now, but soonâ„¢.
