Imagine if you could interact with unity via a shell. What would you do? How would it change how you work? In this video we're going to start building exactly that!

The Unity Shell is being developed as a fully in editor shell. For now the goal is just to build a window you can type into. We're creating our own editor and specifically creating our own input field. This means you can type into the window and we'll detect that input and actually write it out, no Input Field's required!

This is done using the Unity Editor's Events system to detect when keys are pressed as well as some basic design to get a scrolling list of input. The goal is to mimic what you'd see in Bash, Powershell or any other command line interface.

What would you use a Unity Shell for?
