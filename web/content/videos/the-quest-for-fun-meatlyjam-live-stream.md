Developing the finishing touches for Eclipse a #MeatlyJam game designed to make you fear light.

This was a recording from the live stream done during the Jam. Unfortunately a number of settings appear to have been incorrect so the quality is, at best, terrible. However, I think there is still a learning experience to be had here.

Hopefully the next video has less horrible encoding.

Eclipse is a game where the sun burns you alive. A reactor was created to harness the energy and fuel the world. But you need to release the stored energy periodically or it will leak radiation killing everyone. Use the shield generators to block the sunlight and release the reactors energy. Survive the entire day!
