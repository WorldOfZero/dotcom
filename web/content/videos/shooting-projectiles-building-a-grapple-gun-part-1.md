I've had a fun idea. Let's add grapple guns to our Asteroids in VR game. In this video specifically we're going to be focusing on adding projectiles that we can use to attach to the asteroids and pull ourselves in. We still need to add the rope and actual physics parts of this, but for now this seems like a good starting point.

I'm not sure if this will make it into the game or not yet. But it's a feature I wanted to try.
