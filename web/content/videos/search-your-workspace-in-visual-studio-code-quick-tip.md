Visual Studio Code allows you to search and filter your workspace explorer to more easily find certain files within a project. This makes it possible to take large projects and limit what is visible within them so you can find exactly what you're looking for.

You can use this tool to either highlight matches in the complete file tree or reduce the tree so that only the files that match your search are displayed.

In order to do this search, click in the workspace explorer on the left hand side of VS Code and start typing. A box will appear in the top right of the explorer that shows what your current filter is, hovering over that filter will give you an option to clear or change how the filtering is done (highlight matches or filter matches).
