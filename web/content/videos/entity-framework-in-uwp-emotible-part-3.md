Continuing with where we left off with Emotible last time. Let's integrate a database into our app so that we can store the emoji and persist them between application life cycles. To do this, we'll be using the Entity Framework built for UWP. This will allow us to connect a new SQLite database that we will make to our application and allow us to handle both saving data to our database and reading it back out afterwards.

These tools are relatively new (current version 1.0.1) and I have only used Entity Framework for UWP once before. Needless to say, I do not entirely know where I am going. You could say I'm downright lost... Luckily I've got a tutorial. This tutorial (https://docs.efproject.net/en/latest/platforms/uwp/getting-started.html).

Unfortunately I may struggle with reading directions... a lot. Regardless of the troubles we'll figure this out and before this video is over we'll have a Universal Windows App that can save and load data from a SQLite database via the Entity Framework.

Trust me, it's not as hard as I make it look. Give it a try in your own projects for UWP, ASP.NET or any other C# or .NET application you may be developing.

If you are working in other languages look for tools similar to this such as Hibernate for Java. They really do make things a lot easier.
