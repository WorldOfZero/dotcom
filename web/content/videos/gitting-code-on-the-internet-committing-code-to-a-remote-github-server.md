Now that we've explored how to work with git locally lets dig into the remote aspects of it. We'll explore how to clone a remote repository, how to make some quick modifications and then push that new branch up to the remote repository. Once it's there we'll create a PR, review it and merge it. Then we'll fetch and pull our changes back down to our local version.

This should be enough information to get you started working with git both locally and remotely.

We'll also explore how you can take advantage of GitHub Pages, a feature that allows you to host a website inside your Git repo. This makes for a really handy way to create project websites or a personal portfolio.

Want to play around with GitHub Pages yourself? GitHub has a handy website to get you started: https://pages.github.com
