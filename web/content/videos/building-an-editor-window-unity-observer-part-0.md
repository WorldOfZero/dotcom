New project time! We're going to build a fun new editor tool. But enough of that, we'll get to the tool later. For now we need some place to put it. For that we'll need to create a Unity editor window. We don't need to get into anything else fancy yet, lets start simple by building a basic editor window and using the EditorGUILayout etc to build a basic UI inside our editor window.

If you want access to that handy little Unity editor window cheat sheet I referenced you can look here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/editor-EditorWindows.html
