Yesterday we built a way to fly in Virtual Reality using your hands as rockets. Today we're going to expand on that by making an up close and personal version of Asteroids. No ship, no guns. Just you, your jetpack and a few trusty bombs. The goal here is to let you land on Asteroids and blow them up.

There is a lot that can go wrong here, the demo we made yesterday is already fairly dissorienting already and being able to land on an Asteroid itself and actually rotate in three dimensions is asking for trouble. We'll carry on though!

If you want to play the early demo of the game you can check out the game page on Game Jolt (HTC Vive is required): http://gamejolt.com/games/jet-warrior/201273

To do this we're going to take advantage of some of the technology that Valve has created for developing for the Vive and other VR platforms. Specifically we're going to be using the SteamVR Plugin for unity to help us develop this project. You can learn more about that here: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647

The project itself is open source like most of my World of Zero projects. You can grab the source from the GitHub project here: https://github.com/WorldOfZero/Jet-Warrior once it is complete.
