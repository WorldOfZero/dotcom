Our first look at containers and how to use them using Docker for Windows. We'll be creating a MongoDB instance using an image from Docker Hub and then connecting to it using a local mongo cli. This will show some of the basics of how to create a docker component including pulling images, browsing available images and starting new containers from those images.

The end stage is a simple docker container running a mongo database with a single collection that we can drop records into easily. We can even restart it, destroy it and more from simple commands making testing a breeze.

Head to Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/) to grab more docker containers for your own projects! Or head here to grab the Mongo container we use in this video: https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/

Chocolatey is a powerful package manager for Windows that is super useful. I highly recommend it: https://chocolatey.org
