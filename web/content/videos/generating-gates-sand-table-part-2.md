Continuing our development of the Sand Table prototype project we're going to add gates. We'll build two components for this. The first is a script that can procedurally place any number of gates in a circle, the second is able to detect and move the position of gates after they have been passed through.

These gates should allow us to implement a fairly simple way to end the game - if you hit a gate you lose. By being able to procedurally modify the size and number of gates we should be able to more easily find out what a good number of gates might be in the final project and what they look like.

I should also mention, I'm figuring this out as I go. I don't know what will work and what won't. We'll be poking at most of the Unity stack for the first part and learning electronics as we go (they're not something I'm that familiar with). Debuggers, random tangents and project redesigns await.
