This weekend for the #asylumjam of 2016 we're going to be developing a game called Red. Red is a game all about social interactions. A house full of featureless people, one of them is not like the others and one of them is you. Try to find the murderer before he murders you. I know what you're thinking. That sounds cliche. but I think we've got some twists we can throw in.

Today the focus is all about AI. We're going to design and develop a dynamic ai that can interact with the environment. We're also going to need hunters. And blood. Red blood.

For those unfamiliar with the Asylum Jam it's a game jam which takes place over 48 hours. The goal? Make a horror game which avoids the standard hospitals and asylums that are so common in horror games.
