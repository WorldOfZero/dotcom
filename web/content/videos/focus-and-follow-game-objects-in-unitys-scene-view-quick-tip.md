Unity's editor includes a handy feature that enables you to quickly focus on and follow Game Object's in your scene view. The default hotkey to do this is `Shift + F`. When you press this with a Game Object selected the scene view's camera will zoom in and reposition itself to put the object in frame. As the object moves (for example while you play test your game) the scene view camera will continue to track the followed object. When you deselect the object or use WASD to move  control over your camera will return to a manual input and the following will stop.

If you would like to discover more hotkeys in the editor or reconfigure them to your own bindings you can look into the Unity Shortcut Manager. More information on that here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ShortcutsManager.html
