Last video we created a geometry shader and point cloud renderer capable of rendering hundreds of thousands of individual grass instances in our scene at once. Now we're stepping up the game even further by improving the quality of the model we're using and also adding some animation to the model. To get that we just need some basic trig (we'll expand on this later). Over the course of this video we'll look into how to detect change in time and animate shaders as well as expanding our knowledge of geometry shaders.

Apologies for the delay here. That freeze messed up the audio in the recording and it took a while to get it fixed. Mostly because I had no clue what to do. Got it fixed with a program called HandBrake. If you need to fix some videos check it out: https://handbrake.fr
