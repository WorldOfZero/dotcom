Pew pew! Lets take the next step in building our shield shader. In this video we'll be building two things. First a pulse wave that can be blasted across the surface of our material at specific points. Next a script to bombard our shield with a dozen impacts a second.

This will allow us to discover some interesting behavior in Unity and get our shield shader to the point where we can easily represent impacts from anywhere.

You can pick up the shaders code from the Unity Visualizations project here: https://github.com/WorldOfZero/UnityVisualizations
