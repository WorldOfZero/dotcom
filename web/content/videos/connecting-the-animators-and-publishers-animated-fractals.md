Today we're going to be doing the initial solution for solving the problem our animated fractal shaders face. How do we connect our animations to specific parts of the animators. In our previous video we were able to get things working. But it only worked if you limited yourself to either one Publisher or one Animator. If multiple of both existed everything got a bit... overlapping.

In this video we fix that in the easiest way possible. We just physically tie the Publisher to a set number of Animators. This solves the problem but has the disadvantage of being gross. There is a better solution to this problem and we'll look into that next. But this... this is the easy solution!

Let me know what you think in the comments and, if you want to see more, subscribe for new videos every weekday Monday through Friday!

The code is available on GitHub and you can use these shaders and animations in your project! Check out the code here: https://github.com/WorldOfZero/FractalGenerator
