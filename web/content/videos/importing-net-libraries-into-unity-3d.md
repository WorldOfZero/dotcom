You can import .NET Libraries into Unity in order to expose additional functionality in your game. In this video we're going to build a basic demonstration of this feature by creating a brand new .NET Core library and importing it into Unity.

Once the library is imported we can invoke it and create objects defined by it just like any other code.

To create a new dotnet library with .NET Core you can use:

```csharp
dotnet new classlib --name [your library name]
```
