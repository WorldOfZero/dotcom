Welcome back! We're picking up where we left off: developing an epic UI for our windows app. Time to fix what we broke and break what we haven't made yet. It'll be fun. I promise.

We are going to add an Adaptive Wrap Grid from the UWPCommunityToolkit. This should fix all the problems we were having before hand in the last video. Frankly, it will work better than what we had tried in the first place.

After that lets add a Hamburger button to our app. I think we've got a great concept with it that should make everything a lot easier to use. This will require a little bit of side stepping and misdirection. Not because I intend that to happen, I just don't really know what I'm doing.

Once all of that is complete we need to add a notification when you copy text. Let's add a blur behind it because that will look good. At least, that's the idea. There is something weird going on with my version of Visual Studio and Blur is not working. I'll have to look into that.

The project is open source and available on GitHub. Grab the source and play with it yourself: https://github.com/WorldOfZero/Emotible
