The .NET CLI includes the ability to install additional developer tools like powershell. This is a powerful feature that enables you to add tools to your developer environment without leaving your terminal. In this video we'll take full advantage of the feature by installing an animated nyancat tool. My productivity will never been the same!

To learn more run `dotnet tool --help`.

You may use `dotnet tool install [PACKAGE_NAME]` and dotnet tool uninstall `[PACKAGE_NAME]` to install and uninstall packages.

The tool uses the same Nuget package manager that provides your dotnet libraries and chocolatey packages.


You can explore the available tools on [ToolGet](https://www.toolget.net/).
