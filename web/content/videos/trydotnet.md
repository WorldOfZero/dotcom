Ever wanted to give .NET a try? See what all this C# stuff is about? try.dot.net is a website where you can write and run code from your browser.

We're going to explore how to use this to test out some fun new code. Specifically we're going to solve the Fibonacci sequence. Actually, we're going to solve it twice! The first will be the classic recursive definition. The second? An optimization of that solution taking advantage of a dynamic programming solution called memoization.

Admittedly, try.dot.net has some issues: the "run" button disappears and it doesn't always print everything. Still, this is a really cool and accessible way to get coding, and get there fast!

Try it yourself: try.dot.net
