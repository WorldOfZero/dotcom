Twinkle is an audiogame developed for the audiogame jam of 2016. It features an open world sandbox where you can build your own soundscape. This soundscape changes as you move around it causing the creation of dynamic user created music.

This video is a selection of some of the original creations players have created since the games release one day ago.
