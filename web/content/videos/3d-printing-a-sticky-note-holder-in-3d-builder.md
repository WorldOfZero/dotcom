Lets build a very simple holder for some sticky notes and a pen. We're going to look at how to leverage 3D Builder a free tool included with Windows 10 and Cura a free program from Ultimaker. Using these and some great measurements we can build our sticky-note holder.

We'll look at how to combine simple shapes and measure them out in 3D builder as well as how to subtract two meshes from one another. It's a simple task, but a fun introduction to building 3D models in 3D builder and also how to print them.

Want to play with these models yourself? You can download them here: https://1drv.ms/f/s!AigAU5khbym5obJ8xWF3_kqwPD0Vfg

I use a Qidi X-One 3D Printer for my 3D printing: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HZ4HY9I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01HZ4HY9I&linkCode=as2&tag=worldofzero-20&linkId=1b0f5c25239684663c15cde7d343342c
