In this video we finish up the core feature of our app. Specifically copying text to the clipboard so it can be used elsewhere. Once that is done we'll begin positioning the app for a version 1 release.

Besides using DataPackage's to copy our text to the Clipboard, we will also explore creating a new User Control, adding Dependency Properties to it, Data Binding to those dependency properties and styling our control.

There is still a lot of work to be done, but we've got the basics down. That means we get to start making the app a lot better. We'll get to improving that in the next videos.

For now, all we wanted to do was get core features working, and I think we succeeded. A list of text objects than can be copied to the clipboard when you click them.
