We're going to extend our portal. Specifically we'll be adding a cool new shader to the portal. The shader is going to have all kinds of fun stuff in it. Specifically we're going to be turning our portal into a circle and adding transparency. We'll explore transparent unity shaders and discuss a bit about what makes them so different from standard shaders.

Huzzah, more fun shader stuff! This portal is starting to look all kinds of fun.
