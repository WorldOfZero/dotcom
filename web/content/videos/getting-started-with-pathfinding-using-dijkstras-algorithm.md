Lets explore pathfinding by implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm. Dijkstra's Algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that works by calculating the distance from any node in a graph to a target node. To find a path from any node in the graph to the target node you need to find the next adjacent node with the shortest remaining distance to the target. We'll be implementing this for a dynamic graph of bi-directional nodes, however this can be implemented in a similar fashion for other areas like a tile system from a strategy game.

Wikipedia goes deeper into Dijkstra's Algorithm implementation and includes visual examples and pseudo code: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm
