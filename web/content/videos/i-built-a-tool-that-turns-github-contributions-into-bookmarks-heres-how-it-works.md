Inspired by GitHub Skyline I've built a tool you can run from the command line that generates a bookmark from your GitHub Contributions. The SVG the tool generates can be 3D printed or laser cut to create a physical bookmark you can take with you! In this video we'll walk through how you can use the tool yourself by creating a Personal Access Token to gain access to the GitHub API.

To create a Personal Access Token on GitHub navigate to your Profile, select Developer Settings and Access Tokens. Create a token with the minimum number of permissions required for the app you are trying to use. **Do not share your Personal Access Tokens publicly** because people with these tokens will be able to perform the selected actions as if they were you!

***

The GitHub Bookmark Generator project is available publicly on GitHub here: https://github.com/runewake2/GitHubBookmarks

The GitHub GraphQL API Explorer is here: https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer. You can use this to explore and run test queries against GitHub's API.
