Trie's are a sort of prefix search tree that uses prefix substrings to efficiently search and complete a word search. This allows you to search for a string matching a prefix of a large number of strings without having to individually test against every string.

Trie.Net is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gmamaladze/trienet) and [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TrieNet/). You can find more documentation and learn about it's other features here: https://github.com/gmamaladze/trienet

If you want to learn more about how Trie's work as a data structure you can learn more about that on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie

If you're interested in how to build a `Trie` from scratch we've done that in an earlier video you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nmVXKu6e_Q

For more information about the Mermaid diagrams I use at the start of this video, check out [my video on Mermaid JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_2IroEs6Is). Recently support for these diagrams was even [added to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams).
