Lets make a hologram shader that can be used to draw any object as if it was a projection in some science fiction scene. This video covers the basics of the effect and how to achieve some basic additive blending and transparent effects.

Because we are dealing with transparent rendering we'll take a quick dive into the differences between rendering transparent objects compared to opaque ones. Specifically why transparent objects are a bit harder to deal with and why z-sorting them is important.

By the end of this we will have a simple shader with traced lines scanning across each axis of the model in world space.
