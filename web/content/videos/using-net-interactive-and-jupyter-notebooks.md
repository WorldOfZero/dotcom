Today we're exploring .NET Interactive and how you can use it inside of Jupyter Notebooks to run and document code samples alongside markdown documentation. This can be a really handy way to create and share example code and snippets in an interactive way that allows you to just change code and run it inside of the document the code is embedded in.

Jupyter Notebooks are a tool that is part of [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) a project for creating an interactive data notebook. It's extremely common among data scientists and python programmers as a way to document an AI model and show the data that is being worked on. We are able to take advantage of that same platform and provide a .NET runtime (.NET interactive) that allows us to compile and run .NET code in these notebooks. This gives us access to many of the same features while allowing us to write our code in C# or another .NET language.
