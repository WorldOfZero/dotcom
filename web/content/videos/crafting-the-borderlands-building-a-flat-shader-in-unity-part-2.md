Lets pick our flat shader back up. First we need to refactor the code we wrote during Part 1. Once that's done lets move on to the next step of this project: adding a border. This will allow our standard shader to have two colors drawn. This enables a whole number of cool effects beyond just the standard border.

Make sure to subscribe if you want to see more. If there are specific topics you want to see covered or other directions you want me to take this specific project let me know in the comments. Lets come up with something awesome!

The goal of these videos is to break the mold of current tutorials. I want to not only capture how to do it, but the mistakes and learning that comes from those mistakes as well. Ideally these videos will be focused, but not rehearsed. None of what I am implementing here is stuff I have written before.

This video uses Unity 3D and Visual Studio, both of these awesome tools are free downloads that anyone can use!
Pick up Unity 3D here: http://unity3d.com
The Unity 3D installer includes an optional Visual Studio install.
