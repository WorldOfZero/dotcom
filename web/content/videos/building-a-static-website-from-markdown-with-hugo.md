You need a new site for your new project or maybe just a personal site. How will you build it? Hugo lets you build a static website automatically from a set of markdown content. It's easy to use and can be hosted on most web servers including GitHub pages.

In this video we'll look at how to build a simple Hugo website, theme it and configure it with GitHub Pages so anyone can see what we've build. It's a relatively powerful and pain free way to build a website, especially if you don't need dynamic content or large amounts of custom scripts.
