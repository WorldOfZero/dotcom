.NET MAUI is an open-source framework for building multiplatform user interfaces that can reuse code across iOS, Android, MacOS and Windows! Let's dive into .NET MAUI and try to build a to-do app from scratch - learning what's new along the way as I build my first .NET MAUI app.

Let's explore how to layout our own UI with XAML, figure out how to setup a view model and data bind our UI to it and create our own custom commands to invoke. We'll build an app that uses the exact same C# code to write a native app we can test on both Windows and .NET.
