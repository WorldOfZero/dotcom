Lets make Unity Observer a bit more useful! In this video we'll add support for accessing different components by name other than the current support for Transforms. This means you'll be able to lookup any component by its name and then inspect any field/property on it (so long as that field/property is for a Vector3). This completes the basic MVP functionality for the Unity Observer's support for Vector3's. There is a lot more to do still but at this point we have a fully functioning, though hardly intuitive, interface for our tool.

We will also look at comparing strings using String Comparison flags (a more efficient, less brittle way to compare strings compared to uppercasing or lowercasing both strings manually).
