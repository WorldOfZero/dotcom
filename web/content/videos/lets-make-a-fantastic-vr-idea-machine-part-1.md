Lets make a quick VR app and take the time to explore some tools for Unity that you can use to develop VR Applications.

Here is the idea. We're going to build one of those "Cash Grab Machine's" in VR, but instead of money we're going to make it possible to grab ideas. A sort of random idea wheel, but with a bit more awesome!

This is just the start of the project and we'll cover some basic interactions with VRTK and SteamVR as well as putting together a really basic proof of concept. Now that we know it works we'll need to figure out a way to reduce the need to look up constantly. 

In this video we use 3 Unity Assets:

All of them are free and you can grab them from the Unity Asset Store.

SteamVR Plugin For Unity: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647
