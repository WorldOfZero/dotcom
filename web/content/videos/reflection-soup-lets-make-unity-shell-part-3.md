This video is all about reflection. We're going to be adding the ability to support typing in Unity Shell so that automatic type conversion can occur.

What does this mean? As a user of unity shell this will allow you to say "Cylinder" or "Sphere" and have those strings automatically converted to PrimitiveTypes if the Command expects them. The implementation of this uses a lot of reflection.

It's a lot of trial and error and a lot of back and forth to get this working. I've never done anything like this before. It's not as complex as I made it.

The project is open source on GitHub. Check it out for yourself or even contribute back here: https://github.com/WorldOfZero/Unity-Shell
