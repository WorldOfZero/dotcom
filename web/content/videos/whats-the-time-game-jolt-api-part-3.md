Today we're going to be working on developing a Game Jolt API. Moving on from our development of the CI/CD pipeline from the previous episodes we're going to start actually developing our API. Starting with the basics we're going to be implementing a way to get the current time directly from the Game Jolt servers.

This is going to require us constructing our query and signing it. This going to be a majority of the work. At the end of this video we will have a signed request to get a JSON formatted time.

There is still a lot of work left to do in order to complete this. We aren't parsing our results and it appears there are still some growing pains going on with the Game Jolt V1.2 API that we're working through. Still, we will construct the request even if it needs to be executed via a browser.

I also changed my audio filters in post. Let me know what you think. I'm not sure yet about my own opinions of it.
