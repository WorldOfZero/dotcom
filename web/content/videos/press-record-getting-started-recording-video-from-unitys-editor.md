How would you record a video in Unity? You could always point OBS or another bit of software at Unity, but what about high detail cutscenes or cinematics? How would you record those? In this video we'll look into the Unity Generic Frame Recorder an incubating project at Unity that allows you to record video frame by frame at fixed framerates and then play it back later.
