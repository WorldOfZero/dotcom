Continuing to work on the basic design for Unity Interactive, a tool that allows developers and game designers to connect Unity and their audience. In this video we'll focus on more reflection so we can actually define the potential values viewers will be able to select.

At the end of this video we will be able to create a custom poll with unique values specified for each choice. It sounds simple, but when you're working with reflection nothing is simple.

Wikipedia has a fantastic article on reflection that includes examples from a number of languages including C#, Java and more. I highly recommend you check it out if you want to learn more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)
