Continuing work on the World of Zero Game. Live Stream to test things out before Ludum Dare and get some work done on our World of Zero Arcade game. A stream based game played online using Beam.Pro.

This is live stream footage without being cut or edited in any substantial way. 

All of the code for this is going to be open source so you can add your own games and set up your own streams! You can download the code from the GitHub page here: https://github.com/WorldOfZero/Arcade
