Combining the custom mesh renderer window, STL Builder and Archimatix we're going to start working on building a way to export 3D Models from Unity to a format that we can use to 3D print. This will allow us to compose and hopefully print complex scenes or meshes generated via tools like Probuilder (Probuilder ships with an included STL exporter) or Archimatix.

The premise is simple and relies on previous work we've already done but by combining the three different projects we're able to build a pretty handy tool.

The code for exporting STL files is available on the World of Zero GitHub page here: https://github.com/WorldOfZero/STLBuilder
