Extending Bezier Curves. Turns out you can recursively define them with relatively little work. In this video we'll implement Bezier Curves using a recursive algorithm so we can support any number of points from 1 to thousands.

The Bezier algorithm works by compressing two points on a line down to an interpolated point between them. By writing an algorithm to recursively reduce a list of points down to a single point on the line we can solve for any curve.

Grab the code to render these Bezier Curves from GitHub here: https://github.com/WorldOfZero/UnityVisualizations

The first part of the Bezier Curve development is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgCFzoG_BJM
