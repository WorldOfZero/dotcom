Lets set up a Vive Tracker inside of Unity 3D. HTC's tracker gives you six degree of freedom tracking including position, yaw, pitch and roll. We'll use the SteamVR Plugin for Unity to grab the tracker and integrate it into our scene. It's actually pretty simple.

One pain point, both controllers need to be on and tracking. Actually two pain points: the documentation isn't great either.

Regardless, we now have a trackable 3D object that we can throw around or track in any way we want. Really looking forward to the next project we build with this.

We use SteamVR's Plugin from the Unity Asset Store for SteamVR support: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647
