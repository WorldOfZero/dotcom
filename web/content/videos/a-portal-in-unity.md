Let's make a portal in unity so we can see from one world into another. We are going to accomplish this by using a second camera, render textures and some manipulation of unity layers.

We're going to attach a second camera to our portal, render it's results to a render texture and then selectively render to our cameras by flagging different layers with our layer mask.

This demo requires a total of zero lines of code. That's a plus in my book!

Grab the code from GitHub. This project is open source: https://github.com/WorldOfZero/Parallel
