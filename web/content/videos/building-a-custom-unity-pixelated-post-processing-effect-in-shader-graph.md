Lets dive into Shader Graph and how you can use it in Universal Rendering Pipeline Unity projects to create post processing effects for your game. We'll be exploring that by creating a custom pixelation effect that turns any scene we want to render into a pixelated copy of that screen. This allows us to use 3D meshes, high resolution textures and text normally in our scene and still preserve a uniform pixel ratio among all of our assets and even allows us to utilize animations and 3D movement without breaking the effect.
