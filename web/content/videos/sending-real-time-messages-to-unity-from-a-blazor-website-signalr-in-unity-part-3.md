Let's complete our SignalR in Unity experiment by adding a Blazor Website to it. This will allow us to use a browser to send messages directly to Unity to create updates instead of either needing to install a Unity game or run a console app. We'll quickly cover some of the components in a Blazor website as well as how some of the architecture works.

We'll take a quick detour to chat about Blazor Web Assembly (Blazor WASM) vs Blazor Server because I completely forgot what project template I chose when setting up this test project. ðŸ˜…

The architecture of our app looks like this:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Browser App] --> B[Blazor Server]
    B-->A
    B --> C{ASP.NET SignalR Server}
    C -->|Sends Updates to| D[Unity]
    E[Console App] --> C
```

You can create a new Blazor project using either:

### Blazor Web Assembly

```sh
dotnet new blazorwasm
```

or 

### Blazor Server

```sh
dotnet new blazorserver
```

My previous SignalR series shared at the [Microsoft Reactor](https://www.youtube.com/c/MicrosoftReactor1/) where we created an interactive canvas you could collaboratively draw on with the rest of the world!

You can see some of the other content I have planned outside this channel in the Microsoft Reactor (and even come to our in-person events) at the [Microsoft Reactor San Francisco Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-San-Francisco/).
