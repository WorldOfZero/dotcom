3D Rotational Matrices? What do they do? How do you use them? And more importantly what cool stuff can we make with them? In this video we'll look at applying some matrices to objects using a custom vertex shader.

We'll look at using rotational matrices to transform our object along the X, Y and Z axis as well as allowing our mesh to be shifted by an offset or skewed.

The idea for this comes partially from the 12 Principles of Design by Disney and the ultimate goal is to be able to create many of the effects demonstrated here (http://the12principles.tumblr.com) with this shader we're creating.
