Lets look into how to add grass to terrain. We're going to combine instanced rendering and raycasting to dynamically place grass on the terrain.

We'll be working on a lot more as time goes on, but with this implementation we'll be able to draw grass in our scene and start testing how this looks. Some of the other fun ideas we can pursue include adding physical manipulation to this so we can actually physically move objects as players and other objects get near them.

The techniques being built in this video are based on this Nvidia GPU Gems article: https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems/gpugems_ch07.html and mixing some of the learnings from our Asteroid Belt series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEwYhelKHmiiiwlaWWAfeGBBp9B36yN8J

I've done some experimenting with adding a background track. I've actually done this before on some of my earliest videos. I'll be playing around with this some more over time and would love to know what you think!
