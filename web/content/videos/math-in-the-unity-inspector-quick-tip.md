Unity has made it a bit easier to compute some values in their editor windows by allowing you to enter math formula's into the inspector. This means you may enter formula's when you need to input float's, int's or other number values and Unity will automatically compute the result for you.

As an example typing `8^2` will compute 8 squared and set the value to 64.
