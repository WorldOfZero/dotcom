Lets make a new Minecraft server running Minecraft 1.15 for fun and shenanigans with friends.

We'll be exploring Spigot, Bungeecord and Docker Compose in order to get this up and running.

The source code for running the server that I use is available on GitHub. https://github.com/WorldOfZero/woz-minecraft
