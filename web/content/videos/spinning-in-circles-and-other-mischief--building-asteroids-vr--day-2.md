Lets Build Asteroids VR! Specifically lets focus on rotation controls and other movement options like a grappling hook (and potentially more with time permitting).

Asteroids VR is a recreation of the classic Asteroids style of game with a twist. The game is reimagined for VR with new flight, new atmosphere and new mechanics. Lets see what we build.
