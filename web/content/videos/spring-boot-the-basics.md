Lets say you want to make a simple web service in Java. How would you do it? In this video we're going to look into the basics of Spring Boot, a Java framework that allows you to do just that!

We'll walk through the basic getting started guide for Spring Boot using Gradle. This will allow us create a simple Hello World app in Spring that can return simple responses to our queries. To do that we'll follow along with their included getting started guide and expand a bit more about what is going on.

This will allow us to create a simple service that with a single GET endpoint that can return a simple greeting either to the world ("Hello, World!") or to  whoever calls it if they give a name. Simple, but a great start to building a web service.

This is a little bit of a different format than my other videos. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.

Springs Getting Started documentation can be found here: https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/. It includes additional examples besides Gradle including Maven builds.
