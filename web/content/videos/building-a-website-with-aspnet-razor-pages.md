Have you ever wanted to be able to use code to help build your webpages? Maybe loop over a list and create a table or inject user data onto the page without javascript or anything else? ASP.NET's Razor Pages make that possible by letting you add C# code directly into your HTML webpages.

In this video we'll look at how I'm taking advantage of Razor Pages and ASP.NET Core to build the new World of Zero website and discuss some of the basic core features provided by Razor Pages including variables, loops and inline statements. This syntax is a powerful tool when you don't want to add the overhead of Angular or React to your website but still want to be able to create dynamic content.

Microsoft has a fantastic introduction to Razor Pages on MSDN. I highly recommend reading it to learn more about the syntax and what's possible: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/razor-pages/?tabs=visual-studio
