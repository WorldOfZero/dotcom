The next step is dropping cubes.

We're building a game that can be played live using some of the interactive features of Mixer. These games can be pulled up during a stream when the streamer needs to go AFK or just for fun.

To enable dropping blocks we'll create two components. The first will track points where we can drop blocks and allow us to cause a block to be dropped by index. The other will actually take input, in this case from a keyboard and actually cause the blocks to drop by calling the first component.

The next steps after this are making the drop points and camera adjust as the game progresses. That will help complete the gameplay and we can move onto working out some of the other elements and hopefully get to the Mixer integration itself soon!

More information about integrating with Mixer can be found here on their developer portal: https://dev.mixer.com
