Git is a powerful tool for collaborating with teammates but can also be extremely handy when working alone. It makes experimenting with new features and preventing breaking things in your code a lot easier. Let's take a look at how to setup git for a local project so we can take advantage of feature branches and gits version tracking support.

This will introduce some of the basic git commands and will setup a simple .NET Core project and put it under git source control. Then we'll create a simple feature branch, checkout the new branch and implement the feature. Finally we'll switch back to our master branch and merge the feature into the main branch. It's simple, but easy.

There are a number of great options for adding online git repo's if you want to take your project one step further:
