Let's make an app. Specifically, lets make a universal windows app that can run across all of our windows devices from our Xbox One to our Windows Phone's and PC's. To do this, we'll be creating Emotible a clipboard app that lets you copy emoticons from the screen and save them to your devices clipboard. From there you can paste them into any other applications you want. The idea is really simple, but there are plenty of ways we can find to make it more difficult than it needs to be. Let's get started though, shall we?

This episode focuses entirely on getting started with the UWP. We'll walk through a lot of the pre-generated components and talk about what they do and how they work. We'll also begin exploring data bindings (super cool UI wizardry). By the end of this video we'll be able to display a static list of data to the screen and have a command called when the buttons we display are clicked.

Now that we have that foundational work done, we can start really building the app in the next videos.

The concept is simple, but building an easy to use and good looking app takes a lot of work. On the other hand, it's fun as hell.
