Grappling Hooks were recently added to Asteroids VR so I took some time to explore what you could do with this. This is an un-edited playthrough taken from a quick play session with the game. Nothing is polished yet, but it's progress!

You can play the latest version of Asteroids VR on Itch.IO or Game Jolt!
