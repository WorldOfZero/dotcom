Shields up! Let's expand on our shield shader by merging our refraction shader and our existing energy shield shader together. This will allow us to get a refractive shader with energy pulses that can be emitted from it.

This is a simple merging of the two shaders which will make it possible to refract and emit pulses at the same time. Some minor tweaks do need to be made as well to support the vertex shader we use with our grab pass. Even then we get a fully working version with only minor amounts of hassle. It's like combining shaders with duct tape and equally as elegant.
