Twinkle is an open world sandbox audiogame based around sound. The game is being developed as a part of the Audiogame Jam which is still in progress. The game itself has been in development for about 6 hours with all development being live streamed on Twitch (those recordings will be uploaded here on YouTube after the Jam is complete).

Twinkle is all about building a world of sound. It lets you build 3D interactive sound environments with unique music. The music is never the same and changes constantly as you move through the world. Eventually you will be able to save and share your creations with the world.

We'll see where we end up. The Jam runs for another 4 days.

The Audiogame Jam is designed to help raise money for the Royal National Institute for the Blind. You can learn more about what they do here: http://www.rnib.org.uk/
