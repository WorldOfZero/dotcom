# Page Navigation

Multiple panes exist in the UI and are stacked on top of one another
navigation between each of them is customizable. The Web URL is stacked
to compose the layout of these panes.

As an example:

`www.worldofzero.com/abc123/videos`

Will load the `abc123` content in the first pane and the `videos`
panel in the second.
